# CSharpIntroNotes
Learning C#

This repo is the first half of my c# library that shows the fundementals that have been covered. In the intro folder are where the majority of the concepts are.

I have learned with this library:

1. Basic Types

2. Basics of using strings

3. Conditionals with Readline, Ternary, and Else if

4. Objects and how they work 

5. Methods and how defining them helps your code function, and overloading them

6. Collections with array objects

7. For each and for loops. More how to not get stuck in an infinite loop

8. How to collect objects into a dictionary and how to access them

9. Access modifiers and how the different kinds allow certain access of classes and certain objects in your program

10. Learned how to inheret off of a class to make common data usable through out a project
